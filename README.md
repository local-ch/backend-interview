# Backend Engineer - Home Assignment

You will write a small backend application that stores some information about several types of localsearch entities. In this case an entity is a business, a person and a place (geographical location) which carries information about an address and opening hours.

## Entity examples

There are three types of JSON objects

a business located at: <a target="_blank" href="entries_examples/business.json" download="business.json">business</a>

a place located at: <a target="_blank" href="entries_examples/location.json" download="location.json">location</a>

a person located at: <a target="_blank" href="entries_examples/person.json" download="person.json">person</a>

## Backend service
Write a "backend application" with an API that represents those entity objects. Provide the following endpoints: 

GET all entities with optional filtering based on type (business/place/person)

GET a single entity
